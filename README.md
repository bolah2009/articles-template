# Writing an Article

## Why is writing important?

As a developer, you need to write great code, of course, but you'll also be expected to write documentation. To write great documentation, you need to be a great writer, and the only way to become a great writer is through practice.
Every time you publish an article, you improve your personal brand and reputation. Great developers are not just great coders--they are also well-known in the community. Sharing your knowledge is a step towards building a personal network that could potentially offer you strong connections in the development world (and offer you the ability to help others who are just getting started).
When a potential employer searches for your name, you want Google to return more than just your LinkedIn and Twitter profiles. By the time you complete all your projects, a hiring manager who searches for your name online should find results for your open source contributions, GitHub accounts, personal portfolio, and any articles you have written.
The more you write, the more likely it becomes that someone will find your articles. That someone could be a potential employer, colleague, CEO, or even a future business partner.
The articles you publish in online magazines now can potentially serve as writing samples--writing samples that you may one day send when applying to become a guest writer for a prestigious publication or magazine.
Writing forces you to organize your thoughts and externalize the things you know deep down. They say you only truly know something when you can explain it clearly to others; after all, writing helps you find gaps in your knowledge, which will then help you improve upon that knowledge and further grow.
You're going to spend a lot of time communicating in written English with your coworkers, either over GitHub, Slack, emails, or otherwise. The more you practice writing, the more your written English will improve. This is even more crucial for non-native English speakers. Practice makes perfect, and the articles you write now will help improve your written communication later.

## Guides for writing a draft:

- Must be nothing less than 750 characters.
- Do not plagiarise, you can, however, reference sources used.
- Create a repo [by generating a new repo from this template](https://github.com/bolah2009/articles-template/generate).
- Correct grammatical errors with the Grammarly app.
- Write by taking advantage of markdown syntax, for heading, table, image, list, code examples with syntax highlighting, etc.
